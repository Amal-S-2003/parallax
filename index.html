        <h2>Avengers: Endgame</h2>
        <p>Avengers: Endgame is a 2019 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers.
            Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the direct sequel
            to Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and the 22nd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by
            Anthony and Joe Russo and written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the film features an ensemble
            cast which includes Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson,
            Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Paul Rudd, Brie Larson, Karen Gillan, Danai Gurira, Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau,
            Bradley Cooper, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Josh Brolin. In the film, the surviving members of the Avengers and
            their allies attempt to reverse Thanos's actions in Infinity War which erased half of all life in the
            universe.

            The film was announced in October 2014 as Avengers: Infinity War – Part 2, but Marvel Studios later removed
            this title. The Russo brothers joined as directors in April 2015, with Markus and McFeely signing on to
            write the script a month later. It is a conclusion to the story of the MCU up to that point, ending the
            story arcs of several main characters. The film's plot revisits several moments from earlier films, bringing
            back actors and settings from throughout the franchise. Filming began in August 2017 at Pinewood Atlanta
            Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, shooting back-to-back with Infinity War, and ended in January 2018.
            Additional filming took place in the Metro and downtown Atlanta areas, New York State, Scotland, and
            England. The official title was announced in December 2018. With an estimated budget of $356–400 million,
            the film is one of the most expensive films ever produced.</p>
